## Title  
**Borg Master**  

---

## Change Log

### ðŸ”¹ Character Design Overhaul  
**Change:** Original character designs included a TV monitor-headed character, but this was replaced with more quirky, stylized characters.  
**Reason:** The change was made to create a more cohesive and appealing visual identity that better fit the game's tone and digital format.

### ðŸ”¹ Cursor Implementation  
**Change:** A cursor was added in the digital version to indicate where the player is pressing.  
**Reason:** This was based on user feedback from early testing, where players had difficulty understanding their input was being registered. The cursor improved usability and clarity.

### ðŸ”¹ Transition from Physical to Digital Format  
**Change:** While the core game mechanics remained intact, the overall look and interface of the game changed significantly during the shift to digital.  
**Reason:** The visual redesign was necessary to suit the digital platform and enhance user engagement through GUI elements not possible in the physical prototype.

### ðŸ”¹ GUI Additions  
**Change:** A graphical user interface (GUI) was introduced for in-game feedback.  
**Reason:** These changes provided essential visual cues and improved the user experience, which were not present or needed in the physical prototype.

### ðŸ”¹ Movement Rebalancing  
**Change:** Adjusted the distance players could move during their turn.  
**Reason:** Testing revealed that the original movement range either slowed down gameplay or made it unbalanced, so adjustments were made to improve pacing and strategic depth.

### ðŸ”¹ Platform Focus Shift  
**Change:** Development focus shifted exclusively to PC.  
**Reason:** This allowed me to concentrate efforts on polishing the digital experience for a single platform, simplifying scope and reducing technical complications.
