#### Goals for this Module
- [x] Finish design treatment document
- [x] Create concept art
- [x] Finalize core game mechanics

---

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Completed concept art and sketched out the game’s mechanics.
  - Finalized a unique set of mechanics through iterative brainstorming.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Difficulty creating original mechanics without unintentionally copying existing games.
- **Solutions**:
  - Researched diverse board games for inspiration and embraced unconventional ideas to ensure uniqueness.

---

#### Learnings
- Stepping back from a problem can lead to clearer solutions.
- High-quality work requires deliberate effort and iteration.
- Gained familiarity with Unity’s basic controls and workflows.

---

#### Free Thinking
- *"Should I use two dice rolls to determine outcomes for added complexity?"*
- *"Would more expressive faces on player models enhance emotional engagement?"*
- *"Could a modular or hexagonal board layout improve replayability?"*

---

#### Next Steps
- Begin 3D/2D modelling of game pieces.
- Start designing the board’s physical/digital layout.
- Draft card artwork concepts.
