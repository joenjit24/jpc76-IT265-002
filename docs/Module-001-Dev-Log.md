#### Goals for this Module

- [x] Learning GitHub Pages.
- [x] Coming up with a studio name.
- [x] Figuring out what you want to do with your game studio.

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I came up with a studio name and an idea for what I would like to do with that studio.
- **Challenges faced**:
  -  I only had some slight issues with GitHub Pages, finding the link to my specific page as well as a inserting an image.
- **Solutions**:
  -  I used the discord the professor had us join as a resource to figure out the link for the page and I reffered to a guide to figure out how to insert an image on GitHub Pages.

#### Learnings
- Its okay to ask for help, and my professor seems very keen on helping us whenever we run into an issue.

#### Free Thinking
- How can I make sure my game is fairly balanced?
- What engine should I use?
- What is a realistic roadmap/timefram for my game?

#### Next Steps
- The next session would be getting started on my first game. I feel I have a solid groundwork for a game studio and somewhat of an idea of what I want to do.
