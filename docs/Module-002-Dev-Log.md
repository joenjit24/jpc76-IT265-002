#### Goals for this Module
- [x] Study an Atari game to learn the basics
- [x] Think of what foundation you want for your game 
- [x] Learn more about game balancing


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Studied old Atari game Boxing
  - Learned good basic point system
  - Symmetry balancing in my game 
- **Challenges faced**:
  - How to do symmetry balance where it make sense
  - What game engine to use
  - How to make luck work without making it too unbalanced
- **Solutions**:
  - I looked over games where symmetry balancing worked, like CS GO
  - I looked into what game engines I want to use, mainly thinking of working in LUA
  - Games like Hearthstone use luck in a unique but fair way in my opinion, will use as a model

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- RNG
- Balanced pool for every player, still random
- Symmetry like how in CS GO, where both teams have the same weapons but reskinned

#### Free Thinking
- I want to make a very compelling game that involves luck but uses it well like in Hearthstone
- I feel symmetry balancing is important when starting each round as I feel each player should have the same set of options but how they use those options is what will set them apart
- How will the game look/atmosphere?

#### Next Steps
- Find the engine to use
- Begin first steps in coding
- Begin adding assest
- Begin modeling
