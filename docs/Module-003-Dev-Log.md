#### Goals for this Module

- [x] Start on foundation of game first rough drafts
- [x] Actually begin coding/grayboxing on game engine
- [x] Start sketching concept models

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Found a game engine that works best on my laptop
  - Begin scoping out plans for the foundation of the game
  - Drawing light concept art and brainstorming core mechanics
- **Challenges faced**:
  -  I had to message my professor on whether or not I could use a certain game engine
  -  Good color themes
  -  Core ideas
- **Solutions**:
  -  Messaged professor on Discord
  -  Went back to the color theme lecture
  -  Asked AI to come up with some core game mechanics and watched some videos on it.

#### Learnings
-  Grayboxing
-  Color theory
-  Randomized logic for responses by NPCs

#### Free Thinking
-  What if each NPC had a randomly generated repsonses?
-  How can i come up with a good looking color scheme?
-  When will I make the first playable prototype?

#### Next Steps
-  Begin first map design
-  First dialouge conversations
-  First sketched models
