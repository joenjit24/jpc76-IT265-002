#### Goals for this Module
- [x] Set up Unity project and familiarize with the editor.
- [x] Complete foundational tutorials for Unity basics (e.g., scripting, scene setup).
- [x] Draft initial sprite concepts for characters or game objects.

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  -Created a new Unity project and configured basic settings (2D template, resolution).
  -Watched tutorials on Unity scripting (e.g., movement, collisions) and scene organization.
  - Sketched rough sprite ideas for a player character, environment tiles, and a collectible item.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Overwhelmed by Unity’s interface (e.g., understanding the Hierarchy vs. Scene view).
  - Struggled to translate sprite concepts into consistent art style.
- **Solutions**:
  - Broke down Unity learning into smaller tasks (e.g., focused on scripting one mechanic at a time).
  - Used Pinterest and indie game art references to refine sprite sketches (e.g., pixel art vs. minimalist shapes).

#### Learnings
- Unity’s component-based workflow (e.g., attaching scripts to GameObjects).
- Importance of iterative design—rough sprites can evolve during prototyping.
- Tutorials emphasized player input handling (e.g., Input.GetAxis for movement).
  
#### Free Thinking
- What if the game combined real-time movement with turn-based puzzle elements?
- How might the Entity Component System (ECS) improve performance for larger levels?
- Could a limited color palette simplify art creation while maintaining visual cohesion?

#### Next Steps
- Build a basic playable scene (e.g., player movement, collectibles, and a win condition).
- Refine one sprite into a finalized asset using Aseprite or Photoshop.
- Explore Unity’s Tilemap system for level design.
