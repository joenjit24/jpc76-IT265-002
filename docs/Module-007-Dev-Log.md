#### Goals for this Module
- [x] Create a physical model of the board game.
- [x] Test the game in real life.
- [x] Prepare to present the game to class.

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Completed the physical model of the board game.
  - Tested various mechanics such as the board layout and RNG elements.
  - Defined and fleshed out the game's unique selling points.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Creating the game pieces from scratch.
  - Designing an effective board layout.
  - Developing appealing and functional card designs.
- **Solutions**:
  - Sourced pieces from various existing board games to build the physical model.
  - Used paper prototypes to experiment with different board layouts.
  - Drew and refined card prototypes to determine the best design elements.

#### Learnings
- Discovered effective map designs that enhance gameplay.
- Recognized unique selling points like cooperative elements and RNG-driven board dynamics.
- Gained insights from observing peersâ€™ presentations on map design and effective communication of game features.

#### Free Thinking
- Explore more detailed and refined card designs to further enhance gameplay.
- Redo the map design to improve both aesthetics and functionality.
- Consider different mechanisms for player movement on the board, possibly integrating varied movement rules or dynamic elements.

#### Next Steps
- Develop a digital version of the game map using a game engine.
- Create a set of defined cards where each card has unique effects that contribute to the overall game experience.
