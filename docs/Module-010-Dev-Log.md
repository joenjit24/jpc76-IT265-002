## Goals for this Module
- Refine map and movement based on initial feedback.
- Start brainstorming sci-fi elements and mechanics fitting the "Borg Master" theme.
- Continue improving visual consistency across tiles and characters.

## Progress
**What I accomplished:**
- Minor tweaks to character movement to make it feel slightly smoother.
- Adjusted the spawn points visually to match the sci-fi "command center" vibe.
- Started concept sketches for "Borg units" — robotic-looking characters players control.

**Challenges faced:**
- Finding a way to blend sci-fi elements into a simple grid-based map without making it too cluttered.
- Staying focused on finishing basics first instead of jumping ahead to new features.

**Solutions:**
- Decided to keep early visuals simple (grays, blues, neon highlights) and layer in more detail later.
- Wrote down new mechanic ideas but put them aside for now to avoid feature creep.

## Learnings
- It's better to lock down a playable version before getting carried away with extra ideas.
- Sci-fi themes can be expressed even with small changes to color, texture, and names (e.g., "Command Node" instead of "Spawn Point").

## Free Thinking
**Possible future features:**
- "Borg Upgrades" — temporary power-ups like speed boosts or shield generators.
- Environmental hazards like electric fields or collapsing platforms.
- Win condition ideas: Last Borg standing, or control the most nodes.

## Next Steps
- Keep polishing the basic movement and collision feel.
- Finalize simple player and tile designs for the sci-fi look.
- Plan a small internal playtest once movement, spawning, and basic visuals are locked in.
